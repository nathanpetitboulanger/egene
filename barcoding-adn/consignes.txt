   1- Click on the dataset "DS-BBBABSV Dataset of Bumblebee species for a course with ABSV
      students".

What information appears on the screen? Can you describe the dataset? (Number of specimens,
sequences, and species, origin, age of sequenced specimens, genetic marker, fragment length,
quality, etc.)

   2- Click on "View all records".

What fields are included in the table that appears? Explain the meaning of each column. Why are
some entries not associated with any sequence? What could be the possible reasons for this?

   3- Select all sequences and construct a distance tree.
      In the left menu, go to Sequence Analysis > Taxon ID Tree.

       Enter the Following parameters:           Tree Type = Multipage Classic,
                                                 Sequence Data = Nucleotide,
                                                 Distance Model = Kimura 2 P,
                                                 Align Sequences = MUSCLE,
                                                 Select Branch Labels = Sample ID + Taxon + Sex +
                                                 State/Province + Region + BIN URI
                                                 Apply filters = […] >200 bp
                                                 Colorize Tree Based on = Barcode Cluster (BIN)
                                                 Ambigous Base = Pairwise Deletion
                                                 Minimum Complete Overlap = 100 bp
                                                 Codon Positions Included = 1, 2, 3
                                                 Result Options = View immediately



   •   By observing the topology of this tree, can you identify specimens that may be misidentified?
       What do you base this assumption on? What should be done to confirm it?

   List of possibly misidentified sequences: …


   •   By examining the tree topology, can you determine which species the specimens identified
       morphologically only at the genus level (Bombus sp.) might belong to?

   List of specimens and suggested identification: …
4- Another way to verify the consistency of morphological identifications with genetic data is to
   perform a "BLAST" of the sequence, meaning an alignment of the sequence against all
   available data in the BOLD database.
   To do this, go back to the "Records List", click on the sequence page of a specimen you suspect
   to be misidentified. Copy the sequence and paste it into BOLD’s "Identification Engine":
   https://v4.boldsystems.org/index.php/IDS_OpenIdEngine.

    What are the results? Discuss them. You can also check the BIN page associated with an
    individual whose identification you doubt to confirm your observations.

5- Return to the "Records List", uncheck the sequences associated with potential identification
   errors. Then, perform the "Barcode Gap Analysis" using the remaining sequences.

    Enter the Following parameters:         Distance Model = Kimura 2 P,
                                            Marker = COI-5P,
                                            Alignment Options = MUSCLE,
                                            Apply Filters = […] > 200 bp,
                                            Ambigous Base = Pairwise Deletion
                                            Result Options = View immediately

•   Scatter Plots: Take 5 minutes to carefully read the legend. In pairs, try to understand how the
    graph is constructed. What does the red line represent? How should it be interpreted?

•   Distance Distribution Histograms: Explain the histograms presented.

•   To differentiate two species based on their respective sequences, how should the genetic
    distance between these two species (interspecific distance) compare to the intraspecific
    distance for each species?

•   What do the data you are analyzing show? Is this condition met for all Bombus sp. specimens
    sequenced here?

•   Details for Specimens Comparisons: Use the data in this table to precisely identify problematic
    specimens. To clarify the situation, what further steps should be taken?
